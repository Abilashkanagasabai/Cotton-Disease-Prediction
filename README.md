## Overview
In this project the I made model which classifies the disease in Cotton plant and Cotton Leaf


## Motivation
After Learning all the concepts it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.This is aim of this project

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7 If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

## Problem Approach

   * Data can be found in the link given in ipynb file
   * Image is Resized to [224,224] for better results
   * Transfer Learning Resnet152 Version 2 is used for building the model
   * Accuracy -----`94.5%`

## Bug / Feature Request

If you find a bug (the website couldn't handle the query and / or gave undesired results), kindly open an [issue](https://github.com/Abilashkanagasabai/Cotton-Disease-Prediction/issues) here by including your search query and the expected result

## Future Scope

* Use multiple Algorithms
* Make Flask app.py
* Front-End 
* Model Retraining approach
